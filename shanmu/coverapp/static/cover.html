            <p class="content"><font size="3">This book <span class="highlight"> "Computer Graphics"</span> explores the core concepts of computer graphics and explains how images, animations, and 3D scenes are created using mathematical and programming techniques, blending theory with practical implementation through OpenGL, a powerful graphics API widely used in real-time rendering. It shows how basic shapes are generated, how objects are transformed in space, how light and shading create realism, and how viewing and projection techniques help form complete scenes. By connecting geometric principles with hands-on OpenGL examples, the book helps readers understand everything from simple 2D drawings to complex 3D models, animated motion, textured surfaces, and interactive graphics applications, all forming a solid foundation for further study in visualization, game development, virtual reality, and modern graphics programming.</font></p>
